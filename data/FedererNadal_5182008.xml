    <tbMatchComments value="Date:  05/18/08&#xD;&#xA;Event:  Masters Series Hamburg - Men's Singles Final&#xD;&#xA;Surface: Clay&#xD;&#xA;Players:  (1) Roger Federer  vs  (2) Rafael Nadal&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;- Federer up 5-1 (40-30...set point) in the 1st set, Nadal with only 46% of 1st serves in.  Several of Federer's unforced forehand errors resulted when he ran around his backhand.  Otherwise, Federer's forehand was impressive, hitting 7 winners and forcing 2 errors from Nadal.  Federer choosed to serve and volley on set point, hitting his swinging forehand volley out.  Nadal comes back to break Federer, deny a 2nd set point oppertunity for Federer at 5-2 (40-30) and makes a hard faught comeback to take the 1st set 7-5.  Nadal's 1st serve percentage increased significantly to 67%, along with several Forehand winners and forced errors.  In the 1st set, ALL of Nadal's 1st serves (whether in or out) were to Federer's backhand or to the body.&#xD;&#xA;- Federer and Nadal open the 2nd set by trading breaks of serve.  Just like the start of the 1st set, it appears that Federer is going to dominate the 2nd set, going up 5-2.  Nadal fought back, pounding Federer's backhand with 1st serves and ground strokes.  At 5-5 (0-40) Federer faced three break points but managed to hold serve.  Eventually the 2nd set was decided by a tie break, Federer winning the 2nd set.&#xD;&#xA;- Nadal continues to work Federer's backhand and hits some excellent passing shots to get an early lead in the 3rd set, 1-3.  Federer's forehand also letting him down in the 3rd set, resulting in several unforced forehand errors.  Nadal's forehand becomes a powerful weapon in the 3rd set, giving him control of the majority of the points.  Federer starts to win points by coming to the net...but it's not enough, as Nadal wins the set 3-6 and the match...win #108 of the last 110 clay court matches." />
