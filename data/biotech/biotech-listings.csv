Using its this platform, Allostera has developed several novel Allosteramers against different targets primarily focused on inflammation and autoimmunity including APG2305, an oral druginhibiting one of the most important targets in the autoimmune disease field, IL23R.        Commercialization Strategy & Financing Plans   ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Allostera was formed from technology developed by Sylvain Chemtob and Christiane Quiniou at CHU Ste-Justine, a hospital affiliate of the University of Montreal and exclusively licensed to Allostera. Allostera completed a $17M Series A financing in July 2009 and began formal operations.     Between its incorporation in 2005 and the start of formal operations in 2009, the Company raised just over $1M with a combination of grants, debt, and convertible debt. During that time, the company developed seven Allosteramers using its Module X technology. Both in vitro and In vivo animal data was developed for six of these products, supporting the proof-of-concept that Module X could result in active specific inhibitors of cytokine receptors.     In 2008 and 2009, specific oral bioavailability data was developed to supportthree of the products. In Q4 2009 Allostera entered into an agreement with a leading oral peptide drug delivery company to test the lead APG2305 product in large animal models of human oral drug delivery and to optimize the oral delivery formulation.     In 2010 Allostera plans to test the optimized APG2305 in a primate model of human drug delivery and will conduct safety studies required by the FDA, Health Canada and the EMEA prior to initiating human clinical studies.

Eutropics Pharmaceuticals Inc.,EUTROPICS PHARMACEUTICALS INC.,Drug Development,767C Concord Ave.,,,Cambridge,MA,02138,USA,"Eutropics mission is to address the need for effective drugs for treating aggressive forms of lymphoma, leukemia and other cancers. The company's objective is to discover and develop new cancer drugs that are targeted to non-responsive tumor types in cancer patients.    Our solution relies on proprietary compounds that are highly selective for specific proteins that, when targeted, cause cancer cells to die combined with novel, proprietary diagnostic assays that enable us to determine which patients and which cells will be susceptible to our therapeutic agents.    The company's approach is based on the understanding that tumor cells endure everpresent death signaling due to their violation of many rules of normal cellular behavior.  Consequently, in order to survive, many cancer cells become highly dependent on selected blocks to apoptosis or programmed cell death. This survival adaptation is also seen as a cellular Achilles heel, which makes them highly susceptible to therapies that are targeted to the proteins responsible for the block.  Eutropics has developed proprietary assays that can determine if a cancer cell is in such a highly dependent state and identify the specific gene responsible for the dependence. The assay therefore, facilitates the development of a drug that can overcome the tumor cell’s inherent resistance to death by targeting this gene. In addition, the assay will also be used to identify patients whose tumors are most likely to be responsive to that therapeutic. The development and progression of Eutropics' lead compounds into clinical trials will be significantly enhanced by this technology resulting in drugs that will be more specific and effective in treating the  cancer."

The company's lead program, LT-NS001, the first in a family of novel, Bioactivated NSAID Pro-drugs, being developed to significantly decrease the GI safety risks associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).    Forty ninemillion Americans who have arthritis are commonly medicated with NSAIDs. Although effective, NSAID use is limited by serious side effects, notably dyspepsia or gastroduodenal ulcers.. In the U.S. alone, NSAID-induced gastroduodenal complications are responsible for over 100,000 hospitalizations annually at a cost of $4 billion/year, and for 16,000-20,000 deaths/year.  Logica'ls Bio-activated prodrug NSAIDs offer a safer alterternative with out compromising the established efficacy of full-strength oral NSAIDs.    Bio-activated prodrugs are pharmacologically inactive as an NSAID in the GI tract, but once absorbed into the bloodstream, they are converted rapidly and completely to a well-known NSAID.  LT-NS001 is metabolized to become naproxen.  It is being developed to provide therapeutic levels of naproxen while avoiding high local concentrations of naproxen in the GI tract, thereby reducing the local GI toxicity associated with conventional naproxen.    The GI safety of LT-NS001 was compared to naproxen in more than 200 older healthy volunteers.  Using endoscopy to examine gastric mucosal injury, LT-NS001 demonstrated a 79% reduction in the formation of gastric ulcers.  Importantly,  steady state blood levels of naproxen were not different for subjects receiving either the prodrug or traditional naproxen.   Our Bio-activated prodrugs will offer a safer alternative for millions of people who need to use NSAIDs regularly but are at risk of developing gastric ulcers, perforations and bleeds.    LT-NS001 is currently in large Phase 2b clinical study of pateitns with osteoarthritis of the knee.  The primary endpoint is the cummulative incidence of gastric ulcers.  Results are expected at the end of 2010.    The company's  investors include S V Life Sciences, Burrill and Company, Novo A/S, and Novitas Capital.      Logical will seek a commercial parter for LT-NS001.  Business Development inquiries may be addressed to bd@logicaltx.com.

The company has also licensed a patent protected, “tissue-adhesive” and active agent delivery technology invented by a Harvard Medical School professor.  This platform technology is unlike other muco adhesives due to its strong and long lasting adherence properties.    Many diseases and symptoms are treated with systemic drugs which disperse throughout the body when the problem is at a specific body location.  Examples include systemic antibiotics for dental or nasal infections, oral analgesics for surgical pain and systemic agents for nasal allergies.  Local and topical agents are often short acting and do not remain at the point of need because the environment is constantly cleared by the body’s natural clearance functions such as saliva in the mouth and ciliary action in the nasal passages.  We anticipate that our products will be safer and more effective because a lower drug dosage is possible if the residence time for a topical agent can be increased.      OnSite’s initial focus is the oral cavity even though the technology is applicable in many areas of the body.  Once success has been achieved in the oral cavitiy, broader applications of the Company’s platform technology will be pursued.    "

Technologies, Inc. or VITEX, is developing the next generation of anti-infective products through discovery and development of small molecule oral drugs for the treatment of HIV and other major human viral diseases. Panacos' proprietary discovery technologies and lead therapeutic candidate PA-457 focus on novel targets in the virus life cycle, including virus fusion and virus maturation. PA-457 is a small molecule, oral HIV drug candidate.  It works by a mechanism different from that of approved drugs or other drugs in development, by blocking a key step in the processing of a viral core protein called capsid.  This novel mechanism of action, called maturation inhibition, was discovered by Panacos scientists and their collaborators.  Preclinical studies have shown that PA-457 retains full activity against drug-resistant HIV, is effective in an animal model of HIV infection and should be suitable for use in combination therapy with other drugs.  PA-457 is in Phase 2 clinical testing and has shown significant anti-HIV activity in clinical trials, including individuals infected with drug resistant virus strains.  Clinical results to date will need to be confirmed and extended in longer term trials with larger patient numbers prior to approval.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to PA-457.  Fast Track is a process designed to expedite development and approval of new drugs that may have the potential to improve treatment for serious or life-threatening diseases.  Developers of Fast Tracked products have greater access to FDA resources as well as eligibility for rolling NDA submissions.  In addition, Fast Track designation may enable priority FDA review and accelerated approval.

"RedPath Integrated Pathology, Inc.","REDPATH INTEGRATED PATHOLOGY, INC.",Human Diagnostic Development,2515 Liberty Avenue,,,Pittsburgh,PA,15222,USA,"RedPath Integrated Pathology is committed to the early and definitive diagnosis of cancer.  We serve pathologists, clinicians and patients by resolving diagnostic dilemmas.  Diagnostic dilemmas occur in the context of incomplete information obtained from biopsy specimens using traditional pathology techniques and when cancers do not respond to treatments as predicted.       RedPath's scientists recognized early in the evolution of genetic sciences that genetic mutations always precede the onset of cancer.  Through study and experimentation they developed patented techniques to extract objective and quantitative genetic information from the most minute tissue biopsy, cytology and fluid specimens.  By integrating traditional pathology analysis with genetic mutational analysis they developed PathFinderTG®, a diagnostic platform that resolves diagnostic dilemmas.    Diagnostic dilemmas are increasing as advances in imaging and endoscopic sampling technologies capture smaller and smaller specimens for diagnostic testing.  PathFinderTG, however, produces accurate results from these specimens and allows RedPath to lead the way to early and definitive cancer diagnosis.     Without the clear, accurate and definitive molecular-based information that PathFinderTG provides, patients may cycle through second opinions, testing and retesting, and delayed treatment—even undergoing unnecessary or inappropriate treatment.  PathFinderTG provides physicians and patients with an accurate and objective diagnosis, offering strong support for the right treatment plan."

Since the publication of their work (Science 289:905 - 929), their crystallography studies have advanced to include analysis of the structure of known antibiotics bound to the ribosome.  The structural data from the antibiotic binding studies will be used at Rib-X to prime parallel lead optimization programs focused on evaluating new chemistry ideas about antibiotic interactions  with the multiple binding domains or drug targets within the 50S subunit.  Using proprietary computational chemistry tools provided by another scientific founder, Yale Professor William Jorgensen, coupled with the chemical synthesis, biochemistry and crystallographic analysis, we aim to discover new compounds useful as anti-infective agents.    We believe Rib-X technology will offer a competitive advantage because many classical antibiotics work by inhibiting the function of the ribosome.  Pfizer&rsquo;s $1.4B a year block buster antibiotic, Zithromax, is a well-known example.  ntil the completion of the research endeavor of Steitz and Moore, the modes of action of the antibiotics have not been understood in chemical terms.  During the first two (2) years, the research foal will be to use the 50S subunit structural data to design a proprietary class of antibacterial agent that has broad-spectrum activity against antibiotic=resistant microorganisms.  The medical need, the increase in antibiotic resistance and the difficulty in identifyinf new antibiotics is well documented in both the popular and scientific press.

According to the CDC, consumption of bacterial contamination in food causes an estimated 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths each year in the United States. SFS is dedicated to eliminating these vulnerabilities within our food supply chain and increasing safety by developing an efficient, real-time indication of freshness of perishable goods.

Sistemic Ltd,SISTEMIC LTD,Contract Research & Manufacturing,28 State Street,Suite 2300,,Boston,MA,02109,USA,"Corporate Overview  Sistemic is a privately held, product development company that leverages the instructive power of microRNA (miRNA) to provide leading-edge products for the Bioprocessing, Cell (and Stem Cell) Therapy, and Drug Discovery and Development markets. Headquartered in Glasgow, Scotland, with facilities in Boston, Massachusetts, Sistemic provides a broad range of products from robust quality control (QC) for cells and stem cells, to toxicity and drug response based products for Pharmaceutical markets. These products are helping companies worldwide to deliver drugs and therapies successfully and in a cost-effective manner, whilst providing knowledge-rich and instructive data on a range of cell systems.    The Sistemic Methodology  Sistemic’s pioneering products are centred around the company’s IP and core expertise within three areas: robust miRNA profiling, superior statistical analytics and multi-layered contextual analysis.  Together, these constitute the Sistemic Methodology.     Sistemic leverages the instructive power of miRNA. MiRNAs are seen as the master controllers of a cell and, as such, Sistemic believes they provide information on the effects within a whole cell or organism rather than an isolated pathway. This systems approach means that the data produced is more indicative of the biology and more informative of actual effect.     The Sistemic method provides a rigorous yet rapid understanding of the biological changes that occur within a cell. Resulting data allow companies to make well-informed decisions, in a timely fashion. This enables them to develop their cell (or stem cell) therapies and drug development pipelines more successfully and more cost effectively.    Products  Using its proprietary method, Sistemic has developed key products for the Cell (and Stem Cell) Therapy and Drug Discovery and Development markets that are changing the way companies work.    Cells, Cell Therapy and Stem Cells  A major hurdle in the commercialisation of cell-based or derived products is the absence of robust and information-rich QC and characterisation methods to monitor cells easily and effectively. Sistemic’s SistemQC™ product reduces this hurdle and provides a product that seamlessly fits within the current workflow process.    SistemQC™ combines robust miRNA profiling with superior statistical analytics and multi-layered contextual analysis to generate a fingerprint of key miRNAs (kmiRs), together with their underlying biological interpretation, in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. Moreover, the generated kmiR fingerprints can be adapted to a QPCR method for ease of integration and rapid testing. SistemQC™ therefore supports faster decision making for companies, at critical points within their process workflows, allowing them to proceed confidently with their cell populations    Key benefits of SistemQC™:  • Cost effective with a quick turnaround  • Generates early QC alerts at critical points within  the process  • QPCR based method for rapid testing  • Supports strategic decision making  • Seamlessly integrates into current workflow  • SistemQC™ acts as a molecular marker  • Multiple, quantitative outputs from a single assay  .  Moreover, SistemQC™ can monitor cells and stem cells for identity, potency, purity, characterisation, markers for differentiation staging, benchmarking cell model, and QC of batch-to-batch consistency.    Drug Discovery and Development  Sistemic’s SistemRNA™ product range expedites drug discovery and development programmes by providing products that seamlessly fit within the current workflow processes. From the core SistemRNA™ product, Sistemic has derived a suite of drug discovery and development products in the areas of: elucidation of mechanism of action studies; predictive and mechanistic toxicology (SistemTOX™); and positioning/repurposing (SistemKB™).    SistemRNA™ applies a compound-centric approach identifying drug effects by associative changes in miRNA expression profiles and analysis in context. The addition of SistemRNA™ to your drug discovery toolbox can support strategic decision-making at key stages and maximise asset value. The miRNA expression profiles are used to characterise drugs on the basis of :  • Positioning/repositioning of small molecule or biologic compound libraries  • Identify biological activity and Mechanism of Action  • Toxicology profile  • On/Off-target effects    SistemTOX™ builds on SistemRNA™ data to help companies detect compounds which activate pathways potentially leading to toxicity earlier in the lead selection process. This service is applicable to cell lines such as HepG2, as well as stem cells derived from hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes. SistemTOX™ not only gives a simple, rapid yes/no answer, but provides the context needed to gain a much deeper insight. This depth of knowledge allows drug developers to reduce risks within their pipeline and enhance their chances of success.

It is intended as a drop-in replacement for the injectable insulins currently used by diabetics and addresses their most important challenge - achieving tight blood glucose control without the danger of hypoglycemia.      SmartInsulin is a gel that dissolves from the surface inward, releasing insulin only when the surrounding glucose concentration exceeds a specific level.  Once the concentration has been reduced below that level, dissolution ceases and the gel is ready for the next glucose challenge.      SmartInsulin proof-of-concept studies in hundreds of diabetic rats have demonstrated up to seven days of glucose control and no hypoglycemia with a single subcutaneous injection.  Pilot safety and efficacy studies have been completed in pigs and cats.      SmartCells has funded operations with $4.8M in NIH/DoD grants and $3.6M in private investment."

"Spherics, Inc.","SPHERICS, INC.",Drug Development,167 Worcester Street,Suite 201,,Wellesley Hills,MA,02481,USA,"Spherics, Inc. is developing proprietary technologies to enable the oral administration of  injectable biopharmaceuticals and to improve the bioavailability of poorly absorbed small molecule drugs.  The company’s approach to drug delivery is based on the finding that bioadhesive polymers can increase drug particle residence time in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby facilitating the uptake of drug into the bloodstream.  Spherics’ technologies are based on the discoveries of Edith Mathiowitz, Ph.D., a Professor at Brown University and a recognized leader in polymer chemistry and drug delivery.  In vivo animal data supporting the use of bioadhesive microspheres was published in an article appearing in Nature (1997; 386:410-14).  In that publication Dr. Mathiowitz and her colleagues demonstrated increased absorption into the bloodstream of: an erratically absorbed, poorly soluble small molecule (dicumarol); a therapeutic protein (insulin); and plasmid DNA (as would be used in gene therapy).  Spherics is developing three complementary drug delivery platforms having broadly useful roles for delivery of both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals. These technology platforms include: 1.) bioadhesive, biocompatible and biodegradable polymers for oral drug delivery; 2.) phase inversion nanoencapsulation (PIN), a gentle encapsulation process that produces minute, drug-containing spheres of uniform size; and, 3.) bioadhesive, biocompatible coatings, capable of enhancing existing encapsulated and/or controlled release drug delivery products.

Tokai Pharmaceuticals is backed by Apple Tree Partners and Novartis Venture Fund and has raised a total of $57 million to date.    The company's lead drug candidate, galeterone, is the first investigational new drug that can decrease overall androgen receptor levels in prostate tumors and in which three distinct mechanisms of action are combined in one drug. Galeterone is currently in clinical development and is being studied in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Galeterone Development Program    In preclinical studies, galeterone has demonstrated a novel MOA acting in three distinct ways to treat prostate cancer: as an androgen receptor antagonist, as a CYP17 lyase inhibitor and by decreasing overall androgen receptor levels in prostate cancer cells. Galeterone is the only drug in development shown to exhibit all three of these properties.     Galeterone is currently in clinical development for the treatment of CRPC. ARMOR1 (Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response), a Phase 1 proof-of-concept dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of once-daily galeterone treatment in men with CRPC, was completed in June of 2011; however, patients have continued in extension up to 22 months on therapy. Forty-nine men with metastatic and non-metastatic chemotherapy-naïve CRPC were enrolled in the ARMOR1 study; positive results from the trial are being presented at a scientific meeting in 2012.     The company will now take the compound into a robust Phase 2 in 2012 and then a pivotal study to determine safety and efficacy.  "
