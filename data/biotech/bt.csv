Alantos technology thus accelerates and advances the process of small molecule drug discovery via combination of synthesis and screening in a single step and alleviation of synthesis and handling of inactive compounds.  Alantos has its headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany and a research subsidiary in Cambridge, MA.  "

Commercialization Strategy & Financing Plans   ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Allostera was formed from technology developed by Sylvain Chemtob and Christiane Quiniou at CHU Ste-Justine, a hospital affiliate of the University of Montreal and exclusively licensed to Allostera. Allostera completed a $17M Series A financing in July 2009 and began formal operations.     Between its incorporation in 2005 and the start of formal operations in 2009, the Company raised just over $1M with a combination of grants, debt, and convertible debt. During that time, the company developed seven Allosteramers using its Module X technology. Both in vitro and In vivo animal data was developed for six of these products, supporting the proof-of-concept that Module X could result in active specific inhibitors of cytokine receptors.     In 2008 and 2009, specific oral bioavailability data was developed to supportthree of the products. In Q4 2009 Allostera entered into an agreement with a leading oral peptide drug delivery company to test the lead APG2305 product in large animal models of human oral drug delivery and to optimize the oral delivery formulation.     In 2010 Allostera plans to test the optimized APG2305 in a primate model of human drug delivery and will conduct safety studies required by the FDA, Health Canada and the EMEA prior to initiating human clinical studies.

CST offers a broad array of cutting edge antibody reagents to enable the discovery of protein regulation, activation and function within the cell. These powerful tools are designed to advance the understanding of Protein Function, and to open up new research directions in Neurobiology, Cancer Biology and basic Cell Biology. Scientists at CST have established a leadership position in the market for phospho-antibodies. We are committed to developing &quot;smart&quot; antibodies that by virtue of their binding specificity provide important biological information. These &quot;smart&quot; or activation state-specific antibodies reveal whether a protein and its signaling pathway are active or inactive. Our scientists have pioneered the development of phosphorylation state-specific antibodies and generated the first phospho-specific antibodies to many key signaling molecules, including the  major MAP kinases and Akt. The range of these antibodies is expanding and includes cleavage- and acetylation- specific antibodies. CST has developed new methods to produce antibodies capable of detecting general protein modifications, for example, context-independent antibodies that identify phosphorylation at Tyrosine and Threonine residues as well as motif-specific  antibodies that detect Phospho-Serine and -Threonine."

The company's objective is to discover and develop new cancer drugs that are targeted to non-responsive tumor types in cancer patients.    Our solution relies on proprietary compounds that are highly selective for specific proteins that, when targeted, cause cancer cells to die combined with novel, proprietary diagnostic assays that enable us to determine which patients and which cells will be susceptible to our therapeutic agents.    The company's approach is based on the understanding that tumor cells endure everpresent death signaling due to their violation of many rules of normal cellular behavior.  Consequently, in order to survive, many cancer cells become highly dependent on selected blocks to apoptosis or programmed cell death. This survival adaptation is also seen as a cellular Achilles heel, which makes them highly susceptible to therapies that are targeted to the proteins responsible for the block.  Eutropics has developed proprietary assays that can determine if a cancer cell is in such a highly dependent state and identify the specific gene responsible for the dependence. The assay therefore, facilitates the development of a drug that can overcome the tumor cell‚Äôs inherent resistance to death by targeting this gene. In addition, the assay will also be used to identify patients whose tumors are most likely to be responsive to that therapeutic. The development and progression of Eutropics' lead compounds into clinical trials will be significantly enhanced by this technology resulting in drugs that will be more specific and effective in treating the  cancer."

Panacos' proprietary discovery technologies and lead therapeutic candidate PA-457 focus on novel targets in the virus life cycle, including virus fusion and virus maturation. PA-457 is a small molecule, oral HIV drug candidate.  It works by a mechanism different from that of approved drugs or other drugs in development, by blocking a key step in the processing of a viral core protein called capsid.  This novel mechanism of action, called maturation inhibition, was discovered by Panacos scientists and their collaborators.  Preclinical studies have shown that PA-457 retains full activity against drug-resistant HIV, is effective in an animal model of HIV infection and should be suitable for use in combination therapy with other drugs.  PA-457 is in Phase 2 clinical testing and has shown significant anti-HIV activity in clinical trials, including individuals infected with drug resistant virus strains.  Clinical results to date will need to be confirmed and extended in longer term trials with larger patient numbers prior to approval.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to PA-457.  Fast Track is a process designed to expedite development and approval of new drugs that may have the potential to improve treatment for serious or life-threatening diseases.  Developers of Fast Tracked products have greater access to FDA resources as well as eligibility for rolling NDA submissions.

RedPath's scientists recognized early in the evolution of genetic sciences that genetic mutations always precede the onset of cancer.  Through study and experimentation they developed patented techniques to extract objective and quantitative genetic information from the most minute tissue biopsy, cytology and fluid specimens.  By integrating traditional pathology analysis with genetic mutational analysis they developed PathFinderTG¬Æ, a diagnostic platform that resolves diagnostic dilemmas.    Diagnostic dilemmas are increasing as advances in imaging and endoscopic sampling technologies capture smaller and smaller specimens for diagnostic testing.  PathFinderTG, however, produces accurate results from these specimens and allows RedPath to lead the way to early and definitive cancer diagnosis.

The company‚Äôs approach to drug delivery is based on the finding that bioadhesive polymers can increase drug particle residence time in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby facilitating the uptake of drug into the bloodstream.  Spherics‚Äô technologies are based on the discoveries of Edith Mathiowitz, Ph.D., a Professor at Brown University and a recognized leader in polymer chemistry and drug delivery.  In vivo animal data supporting the use of bioadhesive microspheres was published in an article appearing in Nature (1997; 386:410-14).  In that publication Dr. Mathiowitz and her colleagues demonstrated increased absorption into the bloodstream of: an erratically absorbed, poorly soluble small molecule (dicumarol); a therapeutic protein (insulin); and plasmid DNA (as would be used in gene therapy).  Spherics is developing three complementary drug delivery platforms having broadly useful roles for delivery of both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals. These technology platforms include: 1.) bioadhesive, biocompatible and biodegradable polymers for oral drug delivery; 2.) phase inversion nanoencapsulation (PIN), a gentle encapsulation process that produces minute, drug-containing spheres of uniform size; and, 3.) bioadhesive, biocompatible coatings, capable of enhancing existing encapsulated and/or controlled release drug delivery products.  Currently, the company is conducting research under an agreement with Serono International, SA, to develop oral formulations of a Serono-marketed therapeutic agent.  "
