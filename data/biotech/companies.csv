PO Box 7837,Drug Development,Nashua,"Allostera Pharma Inc. is a venture capital funded biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Montreal that has developed an entirely new class of pre-clinical drugs, called Allosteramers. Allosteramers have three main properties: 1) they are ""allosteric"", meaning they do not bind to the same site as traditional drugs potentially providing better safety, efficacy and an entirely new set of patentable intellectual properties, 2) they can have predictable and consistent drug properties, and 3) they are designed to be orally available.     Allostera‚Äôs technology to develop Allosteramers, called Module X, allows target to lead generation of Allosteramers within months. Using its this platform, Allostera has developed several novel Allosteramers against different targets primarily focused on inflammation and autoimmunity including APG2305, an oral druginhibiting one of the most important targets in the autoimmune disease field, IL23R.        Commercialization Strategy & Financing Plans   ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Allostera was formed from technology developed by Sylvain Chemtob and Christiane Quiniou at CHU Ste-Justine, a hospital affiliate of the University of Montreal and exclusively licensed to Allostera. Allostera completed a $17M Series A financing in July 2009 and began formal operations.     Between its incorporation in 2005 and the start of formal operations in 2009, the Company raised just over $1M with a combination of grants, debt, and convertible debt. During that time, the company developed seven Allosteramers using its Module X technology. Both in vitro and In vivo animal data was developed for six of these products, supporting the proof-of-concept that Module X could result in active specific inhibitors of cytokine receptors.     In 2008 and 2009, specific oral bioavailability data was developed to supportthree of the products. In Q4 2009 Allostera entered into an agreement with a leading oral peptide drug delivery company to test the lead APG2305 product in large animal models of human oral drug delivery and to optimize the oral delivery formulation.     In 2010 Allostera plans to test the optimized APG2305 in a primate model of human drug delivery and will conduct safety studies required by the FDA, Health Canada and the EMEA prior to initiating human clinical studies.

Our technology will provide women with a simple, non-invasive, and accurate alternative to testing methods available today. With a single blood draw early in pregnancy, our test will provide valuable information without risk to the mother or her fetus.    With our proprietary microfluidic technology, we successfully and reliably recover intact nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) from maternal blood samples. In the laboratory our device gently separates these rare cells of interest from the billions of contaminating background cells. The result is an unparalleled recovery of intact nRBCs that provide important clinical information.    These rare nRBCs are present in the mother‚Äôs blood throughout pregnancy, even in the early stages, and reveal a wealth of information regarding the well-being of both the mother and fetus. Pioneering work by Diana Bianchi, MD and colleagues has shown the significance of these cells in the development of a non-invasive prenatal test.

"40 Warren Street, 3rd Floor",Drug Development,Boston,"Chiasma is a biotechnology company devoted to developing non-invasive delivery alternatives to the growing list of high-value macromolecule therapies, all of which currently require administration by injection.  Based on in-depth understanding of epithelial barriers, Chiasma‚Äôs proprietary Selective Cargo Delivery (SCD) platform enables oral delivery of large molecules and other impermeable drugs into the bloodstream with unprecedented efficiency and selectivity.  SCDs are proprietary sub-micron particles composed entirely of substances on the FDA‚Äôs GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) list.  These compounds self-assemble to encapsulate therapeutic agents of all types without requiring chemical modification.  SCDs transport their cargo across mucosal epithelium by inducing a temporary and selective opening of the tight junctions that regulate passage between epithelial cells.    The Company was founded by the entrepreneur Guy Yachin, former CEO of the Naiot Technological Center, Professor Muli Ben Sasson, a world-renowned cell biologist from the Hebrew University/Hadassah Medical School, and Dr. Dalia Megiddo of the Innomed Fund.  The company‚Äôs technical team is headed by Dr. Paul (Kip) Martha, Executive Vice President of R&D.  Recently, Chiasma completed the first closing of a Series C financing round led by MPM Capital with participation by ARCH Venture Partners and existing investors Ofer Hi-tech Group and F-2 Ventures.  The company headquarters will be based in Boston, MA, with a research subsidiary in Jerusalem, Israel.    Chiasma‚Äôs business model calls for collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have products on the market or in development that could benefit from the company‚Äôs delivery platforms.  These partnerships will generate the revenues needed to finance the development of the company‚Äôs own proprietary therapeutic product pipeline through applying its proprietary delivery technology to molecules that are no longer covered under patents.

The company's objective is to discover and develop new cancer drugs that are targeted to non-responsive tumor types in cancer patients.    Our solution relies on proprietary compounds that are highly selective for specific proteins that, when targeted, cause cancer cells to die combined with novel, proprietary diagnostic assays that enable us to determine which patients and which cells will be susceptible to our therapeutic agents.    The company's approach is based on the understanding that tumor cells endure everpresent death signaling due to their violation of many rules of normal cellular behavior.  Consequently, in order to survive, many cancer cells become highly dependent on selected blocks to apoptosis or programmed cell death. This survival adaptation is also seen as a cellular Achilles heel, which makes them highly susceptible to therapies that are targeted to the proteins responsible for the block.  Eutropics has developed proprietary assays that can determine if a cancer cell is in such a highly dependent state and identify the specific gene responsible for the dependence. The assay therefore, facilitates the development of a drug that can overcome the tumor cell‚Äôs inherent resistance to death by targeting this gene. In addition, the assay will also be used to identify patients whose tumors are most likely to be responsive to that therapeutic.

101 University Drive Suite A-5,Research Products & Instrumentation,Amherst,"P.A. Technologies is a start-up company located in Amherst Massachusetts.  Our principal activity is the development and use of new reagents and assay methods, which result from innovative combinations of protein engineering and chemical self-assembly.  The products and reagents are designed to be particularly well-suited for biochemical tests of function in complex signal transduction pathways involving membrane receptors.  The underlying technology represents a new platform for assembling and assaying the activity of the critical signaling components, which have created a new ability to assess functions that only emerge as a result of biological assembly.  In contrast to the current art, which is focused on screening pair-wise interactions among signaling components, our methods represent qualitatively new testing abilities, and will permit the many signaling pathways relevant to human disease to be mined for greater understanding and screened for potential therapeutics.  The technology, reagents and assays are optimized for ease of use, reliability, and broad utility in basic research and high throughput analyses.  The ubiquitous role of transmembrane receptor proteins in cellular signaling pathways, coupled with the significant challenges for their isolation and study has generated this need.  This need also represents the driving force behind P.A.

134 Coolidge Avenue,Drug Development,Watertown,"Panacos Pharmaceuticals Inc., formerly known as V. I. Technologies, Inc. or VITEX, is developing the next generation of anti-infective products through discovery and development of small molecule oral drugs for the treatment of HIV and other major human viral diseases. Panacos' proprietary discovery technologies and lead therapeutic candidate PA-457 focus on novel targets in the virus life cycle, including virus fusion and virus maturation. PA-457 is a small molecule, oral HIV drug candidate.  It works by a mechanism different from that of approved drugs or other drugs in development, by blocking a key step in the processing of a viral core protein called capsid.  This novel mechanism of action, called maturation inhibition, was discovered by Panacos scientists and their collaborators.  Preclinical studies have shown that PA-457 retains full activity against drug-resistant HIV, is effective in an animal model of HIV infection and should be suitable for use in combination therapy with other drugs.  PA-457 is in Phase 2 clinical testing and has shown significant anti-HIV activity in clinical trials, including individuals infected with drug resistant virus strains.  Clinical results to date will need to be confirmed and extended in longer term trials with larger patient numbers prior to approval.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to PA-457.  Fast Track is a process designed to expedite development and approval of new drugs that may have the potential to improve treatment for serious or life-threatening diseases.  Developers of Fast Tracked products have greater access to FDA resources as well as eligibility for rolling NDA submissions.  In addition, Fast Track designation may enable priority FDA review and accelerated approval.  In addition to PA-457, Panacos is developing second generation maturation inhibitors and small molecule inhibitors of HIV fusion.

RedPath's scientists recognized early in the evolution of genetic sciences that genetic mutations always precede the onset of cancer.

By integrating traditional pathology analysis with genetic mutational analysis they developed PathFinderTG¬Æ, a diagnostic platform that resolves diagnostic dilemmas.    Diagnostic dilemmas are increasing as advances in imaging and endoscopic sampling technologies capture smaller and smaller specimens for diagnostic testing.  PathFinderTG, however, produces accurate results from these specimens and allows RedPath to lead the way to early and definitive cancer diagnosis.

SFS is dedicated to eliminating these vulnerabilities within our food supply chain and increasing safety by developing an efficient, real-time indication of freshness of perishable goods.  SFS‚Äôs efforts are also focused on reducing the current $43 billion in food waste due to spoilage and contamination annually in the United States.

167 Worcester Street Suite 201,Drug Development,Wellesley Hills,"Spherics, Inc. is developing proprietary technologies to enable the oral administration of  injectable biopharmaceuticals and to improve the bioavailability of poorly absorbed small molecule drugs.  The company‚Äôs approach to drug delivery is based on the finding that bioadhesive polymers can increase drug particle residence time in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby facilitating the uptake of drug into the bloodstream.  Spherics‚Äô technologies are based on the discoveries of Edith Mathiowitz, Ph.D., a Professor at Brown University and a recognized leader in polymer chemistry and drug delivery.  In vivo animal data supporting the use of bioadhesive microspheres was published in an article appearing in Nature (1997; 386:410-14).  In that publication Dr. Mathiowitz and her colleagues demonstrated increased absorption into the bloodstream of: an erratically absorbed, poorly soluble small molecule (dicumarol); a therapeutic protein (insulin); and plasmid DNA (as would be used in gene therapy).  Spherics is developing three complementary drug delivery platforms having broadly useful roles for delivery of both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals. These technology platforms include: 1.) bioadhesive, biocompatible and biodegradable polymers for oral drug delivery; 2.) phase inversion nanoencapsulation (PIN), a gentle encapsulation process that produces minute, drug-containing spheres of uniform size; and, 3.) bioadhesive, biocompatible coatings, capable of enhancing existing encapsulated and/or controlled release drug delivery products.  Currently, the company is conducting research under an agreement with Serono International, SA, to develop oral formulations of a Serono-marketed therapeutic agent.
